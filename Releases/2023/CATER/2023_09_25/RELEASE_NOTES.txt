This update to CATER contains three changes.

1) Re-arranging tabs of the 8:15 Meeting.  'Ops Report' and 'Weekend Report' are now 
to the left of 'New CATERs' and 'Closed'.

2) When selecting a new Area Manager from 'LOV Maint', it was possible to select 
anyone from SLAC, not just CATER users.  It is now only possible to select
CATER users.  The query displaying the current Area Manager has also been edited 
to ensure that the AM will be displayed even if they become inactive.

3) When selecting a new Shop manager from 'LOV Maint', the same issue as above 
occurred.  This has also been fixed.  The query displaying the current Shop lead
has also been edited to ensure that the AM will be displayed even if they become inactive.
