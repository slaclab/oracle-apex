-- Forms 5991/6009/6116. The status is changing from Closed to Work Not Approved.
-- This is because they do not have the person responsible signature in section which was not implemented until 2015.
-- and the logic is forcing status=Work not approved for this case.
-- So need to disable the triggers for updating them.
